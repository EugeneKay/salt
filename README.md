 2. Customize `pillar/defaults.sls` to suit your environment.
 2. Copy `pillar/minion/example-master.sls` to `pillar/minion/<hostname>.sls` and customize as desired.
 3. Install the salt-minion package. Set `id: <hostname>` in the minion config(_/etc/salt/minion_).
 4. Perform a state run: `$ salt-call --file-root=/srv/salt/states/ --pillar-root=/srv/salt/pillar/ --local state.apply`
 5. Accept the master's minion key: `$ salt-key -a <hostname> -y`

Minion Setup
------------

 1. Copy `pillar/minion/example.sls` to `pillar/minion/<hostname>.sls` and customize as desired.
